      <p>Hey there! My name is Catherine and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Washington, Seattle. My primary area of interest lies at the intersection between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. Currently, I am working as a researcher at the Orsborn Lab and the Noble Lab at the University of Washington. I also work in the Svoboda Lab at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics as a SURFiN Fellow. I plan to begin graduate school in Fall 2025.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I also enjoy participating in hackathons, making short films, and writing! </p>

    <li class="fancy-list-item">
      <h5>ðŸš§ SmartMusic</h5>
      <p>This Synaptech group project aims to generate original music compositions based on neural feedback. First, a user trains their own ML model by listening to music they like and dislike, while wearing an EEG. As they start listening to more music, we can use their neural data and the features of the piece they are listening to, to iteratively improve the music, so that we eventually only output music that the listener enjoys. </p>

    <li class="fancy-list-item">
      <h5> âœ… Opticars</h5>
      <p>Mini Arduino cars controlled by eye movements - including saccades to set directions and blinks to control stop/go actions.</p>

		<!-- <li class="fancy-list-item">
      <h5>ðŸš§ LLM Tribes</h5>
      <p> This project was inspired by <a href = "https://wandb.ai/vincenttu/blog_posts/reports/A-Deep-Dive-into-LangChain-s-Generative-Agents--Vmlldzo1MzMwNjI3#the-paper">"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"</a>. In my LLM Tribes project, I am dividing up generative agents into "tribes", where each tribe has the same prompts as every other tribe, but they all use a unique LLM when generating actions or dialogue. Every tribe's goal is to take over the territory. I thought it would be interesting to compare the actions and 'aggression' of various models, and also look into problems with "cheating", like hallucinations or problems with memory.</p>

    <li class="fancy-list-item">
      <h5>âœ… Painting with Brainwaves</h5>
      <p>I made this Synaptech project on my own to host at UW's "Dawg Daze" events and the "Engineering Launch" event. It is an app that translates your brainwaves into emotions, and then into pictures -- like a waterfall surrounded by birds or a castle on fire! Alternatively, for a less "random" and more rule-based result, I can turn your brainwave activity into fractal patterns with changing colors. I made a nice & intuitive UI for the app too!</p>

		<li class="fancy-list-item">
      <h5>âœ… Music and Mental Health (MxMH)</h5>
      <p>This was my first solo long-term machine-learning project! The goal was to analyze the correlation (if any) between music taste and mental health. First, I created a survey to gather data (700+ instances) and deployed a website to advertise the project and boost the number of survey responses. Then, I published an exploratory data analysis notebook with my conclusions. I published a second notebook with some ML experiments, aiming to predict depression, anxiety, OCD, and insomnia scores from music habits. Finally, I deployed the top-performing model to the web, which included visualizations comparing its predictions of a new individual to the 700 data points I previously collected. </p>

      <p>In addition to writing code or writing screenplays, I write for my own <a href = "https://crasgaitis.medium.com">Medium blog</a>. Lately, I've been self-publishing but I've also worked with publications like ILLUMINATION, The UX Collective's Bootcamp, Everyday Science, Newtonian Curiosity, etc.! </p>
      <p>I'm also a 2x "Top Writer" on Medium for the "Space" and "Innovation" topics.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy writing for the quarterly <a href = "https://www.smorescience.com/">Smore magazine</a>, which is a STEM magazine for kids! I mostly write on astronomy topics.</p>
