      <p>Hey there! My name is Catherine and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Washington, Seattle.
        My primary area of interest is artificial intelligence, although I'm also enthusiastic about neuroscience and space science!
        I previously worked on applied reinforcement learning at NASA JPL, and I'm currently working on some other cool projects at UW's Orsborn Lab and Behavioral Ecophysics Lab. </p>
      <p>In my free time, I also enjoy participating in hackathons, making short films, and writing! </p>
