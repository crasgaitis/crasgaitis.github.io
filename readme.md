  <h2>My continuously, in-progress portfolio site </h2>

So, you've stumbled upon the code repo for my portfolio website! To be honest, the code is a bit "spaghetti-fied" so parse at your own risk. üçù 

Actually, why are you looking at the readme anyway? Go check out my website here: <a href = "https://crasgaitis.github.io/"> https://crasgaitis.github.io/</a>. It's way cooler than a markdown file.

 <h2>For the dev's... </h2>

An increasingly common (and frankly, flattering) question I've been getting recently is what template I used to create my website. This is actually a custom site, but please feel free to fork and make it your own! At some point, I do plan to clean up my code and add proper documentation so it'll be easier for you to work with as a template. In the meantime, feel free to message me any questions or concerns at <a href="mailto:catraz@live.com"> catraz@live.com </a>
